# Daily Pulse! A website for all your NEWS!

## Description

This site is a news site that allows users to view the top news stories of the day. Users can also search for news stories by topic. On this site readers can read about the headline and click on the link to read a small description of the story. The site also allows users to jump to the main source of the articles so that the users can read the full story if it interests them.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this site is not to be mainstream news displaying site instead, it will be minimal design website along with minimal content so that the user can just read the headlines to get updated and if they want to read more they can click on the link to read the full story. This will save their time as well as they will be updated with the news. The site will be responsive so that it can be viewed on any device.

## Story behind the project

This site was developed during the Hackathon at Scaler School of Technology. The site was developeed within 3 hours of time. The site was developed by individual efforts and the site was developed mainly by using React and Google NEWS API.

## Major Difficulty faced

As the site is not very complex so not many difficlties were faced in developing it but the main difficulty faced was to get the data from the API and then displaying it on the site. The API that was used didn't supported CORS while hosting the website so the data was not fetched from the API when it was deployed. With the help of the mentors, batchmates and some research the issue was resolved after changing the API to Google NEWS API.
